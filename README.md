***Still a work in progress***

# How To Use
- `go run main.go g` for Google search
- If you run main.go without the `g` subcommand/flag it will exit with error
    - this is intentional for right now
    - I plan on allowing users to set default search engines so you don't have to type in a flag every time

# TODO
- Run program with `sea` keyword
- Allow users to change settings
    - change domain, language, number of requests, and proxy
    - use a flag such as `-s` or `-settings`
- Add Bing Scraper
- let user choose between Google or Bing
